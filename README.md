## Project: Image Classification
---

### Overview

In this project, I classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset is preprocessed, and then a convolutional
neural network is trained on all the samples. I normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer,
max pooling layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, I run predictions on the sample images.

### Installation Requirements

This project is built using the following libraries and frameworks:

- Python 3.6.1
- tqdm 4.11.2
- numpy 1.12.1
- matplotlib 2.0.2
- scikit-learn 0.18.1
- tensorflow 1.2
